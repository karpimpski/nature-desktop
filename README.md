# Nature Desktop
This is a small app that I made that fetches an image from r/EarthPorn and sets it as the user's desktop background.

## Download instructions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karpimpski/nature-desktop.git && cd nature-desktop
python main.py
```

## Build instructions (from root of project):
```bash
python
>>> import config
>>> config.build_windows()
```

Or, more simply, go to https://karpimpski.github.io/app-download/ and follow the instructions there to install the app (no Python or pip dependencies required).
